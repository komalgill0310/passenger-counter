# **Passenger Counter**

# Overview

Welcome to the Passenger Counter website! ðŸš‡ This interactive platform allows you to track the number of people entering a subway throughout the day. The initial display shows 0, indicating that there are currently no passengers in the subway. As people enter, use the increment button to update the count. If you want to keep a record of the entries, simply click on the save button. The saved entries will be displayed next to the "Previous Entries" text for reference.

## What I've Learned

This project has been instrumental in expanding my understanding of DOM manipulation.

This simple yet effective project serves as a valuable introduction to the world of DOM manipulation.
